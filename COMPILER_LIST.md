# Systems Languages

## Rust
Unique for its strict verification of ownership and memory.

### rustc
Official compiler for the language. Self hosted in Rust (originally in OCaml).
Uses LLVM for backend for code generation.

### gccrs
Alternative compiler built as a frontend for the GCC compiler instructure.
Lacks a full feature borrow checker. Written in C++11.

## C/C++/Obj-C/Obj-C++
C is one of the oldest systems language with very few abstractions. C++
started as a superset of C with many more features but has evolved into its
own language. Due to similarities, both often come in the same compiler. Obj-C
and Obj-C++ are both evolutions to the respective languages, commonly associated
with Apple development before Swift.

Minimal language known for allocator awareness and avoiding implicit
abstractions.
